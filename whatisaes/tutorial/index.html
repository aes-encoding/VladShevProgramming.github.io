		<h2>For AES.exe, HSED.exe and ED.exe:</h2>
		<p>The init.aesp file contains all of the changable settings used by AES.exe
		and ED.exe. In its format, it is quite similar to a .ini file, however there
		are some major differences.</p>
		
		<p>Note: The lines/sections in the init.aesp file can come in any order and,
		if not found, will be set to their defaults (though some lines, of course.
		are necessary). Making an (or setting a) erroneous line/value will not crash
		the program, but will be ignored - so commenting is easy.</p>

		<p>The init.aesp file consists of sections and lines: sections are in the format
		of "[SectionName]" and lines are in the format of "setting=value" (Ignore the
		quotation marks). They all are case-sensitive and space-sensitive.</p>

		<p>The general format is as follows (double quotes mean string value, int means
		integer value, bool means boolean(true/false)).</p>

		<div id="ul-list">
			<p>[Settings]</p>
			<p>input="path"</p>
			<p>output="path"</p>
			<p>chk_output="path"</p>
			<p>keys=["password1","password2","password3"]</p>

			<p>printChkOutputTo=bool</p>

		<p>Here's what they mean:</p>
		<div id="ul-list2">
			<p>[Settings] - the settings section of init.aesp</p>
			<p>input - the path of the file to be encrypted/decrypted</p>
			<p>output - the path where the encrypted/decrypted file is to go</p>
			<p>chk_output - the path where the check-encrypted file is to go (only in ED.exe)</p>
			<p>keys - any number of string keys, in the above format</p>
			<p>numKeys - the same number as the above keys of positive non-zero integers, in the above format</p>
			<p>sequence - e or d (encryption or decryption)</p>
			<p>[Debug] - the dubg section of init.aesp - not necessary</p>
			<p>printInput - whether or not to print the information (specified in the print-input section of init.aesp) before the program runs</p>
			<p>printOutput - whether or not to print the information (specified in the print-output section of init.aesp) before the program runs</p>
			<p>printProg - whether or not to print the progress while the program is running</p>
			<p>[P_Input] - the print-input section of init.aesp</p>
			<p>printKeys - what keys to print before the program runs - either all or several, specified by list-indexes</p>
			<p>printNumKeys - what combination keys to print before the program runs - either all or several, specified by list-indexes</p>
			<p>printInputFrom - whether ot not to print the initial file's location before the program runs</p>
			<p>printOutputTo - whether ot not to print the final file's location before the program runs</p>
			<p>printChkOutputTo - whether or not to print the check-enrypted file's location before the program runs (only in ED.exe)</p>
			<p>[P_Output] - the print-output section of init.aesp</p>
			<p>printOutputedTo - whether or not to print the final file's location after the program runs</p>
			<p>printChkOutputedTo - whether or not to print the check-encrypted file's location after the program runs (only in ED.exe)</p>
			<p>printInitSize - whether or not to print the initial file's size after the program runs</p>
			<p>printFinalSize - whether or not to print the final file's size after the program runs</p>
			<p>printCompRatio - whether or not to print the compression ratio of the sizes between the initial abd final files (derived by final/initial)</p>
			<p>[Adv] - the advanced section of init.aesp</p>
			<p>encLtrs - the type of file made after encryption</p>
			<p>decLtrs - the type of file made after decryption</p>
			<p>chkLtrs - the type of file made after check-encryption (only in ED.exe)</p>
		</div>
		<p>The hs_init.aesp has a very similar format wih the exception of the debug, print-input and print-output sections.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h2>For ED_B.exe:</h2>
		<p>As ED_B.exe uses the same initialization file as AES.exe, HSED.exe and ED.exe yet uses a completely different encoding
		algorithim, there are some differences:</p>
		<div id="ul-list3">
			<p>- there is a new field - Settings/passEnc="" . This is the optional password-encoding (only in 1.0.2 and up) used to encode the password from a string into bytes. Working encodings are: utf-8, utf-16, utf-32, utf-32-le, utf-32-be, ascii, ansi and latin-1. Others may work, but not guaranteed - therefore not included in InitWritter.exe</p>
			<p>- the Settings/keys portion has a different format. Use keys="[password]" as ED_B.exe uses only one password.</p>
			<p>- the Settings/numKeys is pointless as ED_B.exe does not use combination indexes.</p>
			<p>- as ED_B.exe only uses one password, for the P_Input/printKeys use printKeys="all" - strange things may happen if you don't.</p>
			<p>- of course, P_input/printNumKeys is pointless.</p>
