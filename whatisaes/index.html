		<p>The download package of AES consists of several files:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>ED.exe</li>
			<li>AES.exe</li>
			<li>HSED.exe</li>
			<li>InitWritter.exe</li>
			<li>init.pfap</li>
			<li>hs_init.pfap</li>
			<li>MSVCR100.dll</li>
			<li>state.txt</li>
			<li>versions.txt</li>
		</ul>
		<p>ED.exe is the standard AES encoding program. Run this, after setting up init.pfap (see below)</p>
		<p>AES.exe is the high-security version of ED.exe. It might take a bit longer to run as it essntially
		encodes the file twice: the first time with random passwords (that are then appended) to the file, and
		then with the passwords you specified. It is far stronger and is on par with back and military encryptions,
		but is more resource-intensive.</p>
