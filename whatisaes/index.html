		<h2>AES download package</h2>
		<p>The download package of AES consists of several files:</p>
		<div id="ul-list">
			<p>ED.exe</p>
			<p>AES.exe</p>
			<p>HSED.exe</p>
			<p>ED_B.exe</p>
			<p>init.aesp</p>
			<p>InitWritter.exe</p>
			<p>hs_init.aesp</p>
			<p>MSVCR100.dll</p>
			<p>state.txt</p>
			<p>versions.txt</p>
		</div>
		<p>ED.exe is the standard AES encoding program. Run this, after setting up init.pfap (see below)</p>
		<p>AES.exe is the high-security version of ED.exe. It might take a bit longer to run as it essntially
		encodes the file twice: the first time with random passwords (that are then appended) to the file, and
		then with the passwords you specified. It is far stronger and is on par with bank and military encryptions,
		but is more resource-intensive.</p>
		<p>HSED.exe is a system file used by AES.exe - not a good idea to run it on its own.</p>
		<p>ED_B.exe is a brand-new update - it can encode binary files. It is standalone and is incompatible with
		ED.exe, AES.exe and HSED.exe as it uses a completely different encoding algorithm.</p>
		<p>init.aesp is the initialization file used by both AES.exe and ED.exe - if you know how to, you can write
		it by hand (see my tutorial <a href='tutorial/index.html'>here</a>); if not, use InitWritter.exe (see below).</p>
		<p>InitWritter.exe is a program that will help you write init.aesp - this is the easier, though slower, way.</p>
		<p>hs_init.aesp is the initialization file used by HSED.exe - don't change it, AES.exe will write it for you.</p>
		<p>MSVCR100.dll is a Windows application extention needed to run AES.exe, ED.exe, HSED.exe and InitWritter.exe and ED_B.exe.</p>
		<p>state.txt is a file used by AES.exe and HSED.exe to exchange information - when neither of them is running,
		it should be empty.</p>
		<p>versions.txt is the file containing the version of the AES - as tempting as it is, don't change
		it to something like 9001 as the versions are actually used by the programs.</p>

		<h2>Source Code</h2>
		<p>AES is currently open source - it was made in Python 3.4.3.4 but should be compatible with any version of
		Python 3. No 3rd-party modules are used in the code. Download the source <a href='../download_source/index.html'>here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Tested platforms</h2>
		<p>All of the programs included were tested on Windows 7, 8 and 10. No compatibility issues were found. AES might run on Ubuntu via WINE - no guarantee give, though.</p>

		<h2>Supported file formats</h2>
		<p>AES currently supports any file format. Has been tested of .exe , .zip , .png , .jpg , .doc and .txt files.</p>
