		<h2>News</h2>
			<p>Brick Smasher 1.6 has come out!</p>
			<p>This update features:</p>
			<p>	-an inordinate amount of shitty graphics</p>
			<p>     -difficulty system (see below)</p>
			<p>     -lives (You start with 3 and gain 3 per level)</p>
			<p>     -the ball will no longer get stuck in several blocks</p>
			<p>     -a 'log.bsd' file in the assets folder - open this in notepad for a view into the inner workings of the program.</p>
			<p>     -achievements system (see <a href='achievements/index.html'>here</a> for spoilers)</p>
			<p>     -1200 lines of code >:D</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>There are 3 difficultes (easy, meduim, and hard). Gameplay in pre-1.6 is equivalent to easy in 1.6 . Medium yields 2x the score, and</p>
			<p>hard yields 3x. However, the ball and pad will move at 2x and 3x the speed, respectively.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>All of the BSD files (BrickSmasher Documents) in the assets folder are encrypted (except for 'log.bsd'), so don't try to edit them.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Brick Smasher 1.5 has come out!</p>
			<p>This update features:</p>
			<p>     -even more shitty graphics!</p>
			<p>     -more sound and video effects</p>
			<p>     -many, many bug fixes</p>
			<p>     -menu screen!</p>
			<p>     -score system, saved locally</p>
			<p>     -ESC is now return to menu</p>
			<p>     -the ball will now not occasionally fly outside the screen</p>
			<p>     -completely new and revamped structure</p>
			<p>     -generally improved performance</p>
			<p>     -the non-existence of one bug that took me a total of 8 hours to fix</p>
			<p>     -almost 900 lines of code (the longest standalone code I have ever made)</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Peoples, don't change any files outside of the assets folder, or (big surprise) IT WILL NOT WORK. Also,</p>
			<p>don't try to give yourself infinite score - the data is encrypted :-)</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>About score, this is how it works:</p>
			<p>     -hitting a block will give you 10 score (damaging blocks with bombs counts as hitting them)</p>
			<p>     -that amount will increase every level (+10 score on level 1, +20 on level 2, +30 on level 3, etc.)</p>
			<p>     -you lose 1 score every ~2 seconds (depends on lag)</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Brick Smasher 1.4 has come out!</p>
			<p>This is the first major update, which features:</p>
			<p>     -more shitty graphics</p>
			<p>     -levels now have text</p>
			<p>     -bombs will no longer destroy random blocks</p>
			<p>     -the ball won't try to bounce on the pad until launched</p>
			<p>     -pressing the space bar won't make the ball spontaneously change direction in midflight</p>
			<p>     -added bigger bomb</p>
			<p>     -there are now 2 types of troll bricks - the harmless troll (it's not a bug!) and the troll troll (leave this one alone)</p>
			<p>     -spooky scary skeleton block</p>
			<p>     -over 600 lines of code :-)</p>
			<p>This update has some new command architecture, and so now if the program crashes email me the text that will appear in the black</p>
			<p>window (to <a href='https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox'>vladshev8@gmail.com</a>).</p>
			<p>Remeber:
			<p>     -arrow keys to move the pad
			<p>     -space to launch ball
			<p>     -G to skip to next level
			<p>     -P to pause
			<p>Make sure to play with the sound on!</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Brick Smasher 1.3 has come out!</p>
			<p>This update features the handsome troll brick (lol) as well as 5 more levels. And of course, more bug fixes.</p>
			<p>As it is doubtful that anyone would have the patience to win the first 9 levels many many times (the 10th levels is quite difficult),
			<p>pressing G teleports you to the next level.
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Brick Smasher 1.2 came out!</p>
			<p>This update adds the bouncy brick (makes the ball go faster) and the bomb (sort of self-explanatory)!
			<p>This update also features several new, 1.2 exclusive bugs! (And several bug fixes that affected 1.1)</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Brick Smasher 1.1 came out!</p>
			<p>This update adds the steel brick and revamped levels!</p>
			<p>(As well as several bug fixes)</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Brick Smasher 1.0 came out!</p>
			<p>Shoot your way through 5 challenging levels and not 1, not 2, but 3 types of bricks!</p>
			<p>The next updates will add more content!</p>
