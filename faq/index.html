		<p>Q: I did everything as per instructions, but the program keeps on crashing. Why?</p>
		<p>A: Because of the way the algorithim works, some combinations of passwords, number-passwords(combination indexes) and the text are erroneous. Just change your password(s) and it should work.</p>
		<p>Q: Is there a mac/linux version of AES?</p>
		<p>A: No, at the momment there isn't - though it will come in a future update.</p>
		<p>Q: How strong is AES?</p>
		<p>A: Let's do some math. The way the algorithim works is that every combination of passwords and number-passwords has different results, and as there can be any number of passwords there are infinite combinations.
		But, let's say, your using standard AES encryption with 3 8-character long passwords - as there are up to 65536 possible UTF-8 charcters that would mean that there 5.19 * 10^33 different 8-character passwords, and
		combining them all, there is 1.40*10^123 combinations for the given parameters - so if someone was trying to decrypt your file (knowing that you used 3 8-character passwords) by trying every single combination...
		that would take them only 1.48*10^118 years to finish,  which is far, far longer than our universe will last. And that is with a standard encryption - the high-security one is far stronger.</p>
